# About Me

I’m **Felix Marwuko**, an IT and data professional based in South Korea. My work sits at the intersection of **AI, databases, and automation**. I enjoy taking messy real-world problems and turning them into systems that are structured, measurable, and actually useful.

I recently completed my **Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (Data Science)** at **University of Massachusetts Global**, while also studying **AI and Big Data** at **Woosong University**. Alongside my studies, I’ve been supporting teaching and analytics work as a **Teaching Assistant (TA)**, which keeps me close to real classrooms, real data, and real people.

## What I Do

I design and build:

- **Data-driven systems** – relational databases, schemas, and queries that keep information clean, consistent, and auditable.  
- **AI-powered tools** – assistants and workflows that take natural-language input and connect it to real actions in tools like Excel, PowerPoint, dashboards, and web apps.  
- **Practical web applications** – focused more on reliability and clear UX than on fancy effects, using modern JavaScript frameworks when they make sense.

Most of my projects start from a concrete need: a legal services firm needing a better database, investors needing portfolio analytics, or students and professionals who want AI to help them with real work instead of just generating text.

## Skills and Tools

I work with a mix of data, software, and cloud tools, including:

- **Programming & Data**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, SQL (MySQL, SQL Server), basic R  
- **Databases & Modeling**: relational design, ER diagrams, normalization, business rules, stored queries  
- **Analytics & BI**: Excel, Power BI, Tableau, data cleaning, dashboards, reporting  
- **Web & Apps**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Astro, React, Node.js, HTML/CSS, Tailwind  
- **Cloud & AI**: AWS (including projects from the Future AI Scientist program), Google Cloud, LLM-based assistants, basic RAG patterns

I care more about understanding the **problem** than chasing the latest stack. Tools are there to support clear thinking and good systems design.

## Education & Certifications

- **B.S. Information Technology (Data Science)** – University of Massachusetts Global  
- **AI & Big Data studies** – Woosong University, South Korea  
- **Future AWS AI Scientist Program** – Udacity x AWS (completed)  
- **CompTIA and IT certifications** – including A+ and related IT specialist credentials

My academic path has been anything but linear: transferring credits, combining online programs, and studying while working abroad. That experience strongly influences how I design systems that are flexible but still structured.

## Teaching and Collaboration

At **Woosong University**, I support faculty as a **Teaching Assistant** for courses such as Lean Six Sigma, Digital Marketing, and other business and technology subjects. My work typically includes:

- Helping manage course logistics, attendance, and grading  
- Supporting students who are struggling with concepts or tools  
- Providing feedback on assignments and projects  
- Helping connect course content to real-world technology and data use cases

I enjoy working with students from different backgrounds, especially those navigating international studies and online programs, because I’ve been in that position myself.

## Selected Project Areas

Some of the projects I’ve been working on include:

- **AVA – AI Virtual Assistant for Workflows**: A modular assistant that turns natural-language instructions into tasks in Excel, PowerPoint, and dashboards.  
- **InvestWise – Portfolio Management System**: A SQL-backed system that tracks client accounts, transactions, and asset performance with clear business rules and reporting.  
- **WeWin Legal Services Database**: A relational database and reporting solution for legal services, with a focus on governance, compliance, and client history.  
- **AutoDutyChecker (Ghana)**: A prototype that helps estimate import duties for used cars shipped to Ghana, built from real business constraints.  
- **AI Law Assistant (Ghana)**: An early-stage concept for an assistant that helps citizens and legal professionals quickly find relevant laws and constitutional references.

Not every project is public yet, but each one teaches me something new about how people actually use systems in the real world.

## What I’m Exploring Now

Lately I’ve been focused on:

- Making AI assistants **reliable and grounded** with good data and clear constraints  
- Improving my **data engineering** skills: pipelines, quality checks, and reproducible workflows  
- Turning my experience as a student and TA into practical guides for others who want to build careers in **IT, data, and AI**  
- Exploring international opportunities where I can combine technical work with teaching and mentoring
