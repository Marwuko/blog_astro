Image-to-video generation is one of the most exciting areas in modern AI.  
This project started as an experiment, but quickly became a deep exploration  
into how sequence-generation models work.

## What I Explored
- HuggingFace video diffusion models  
- Motion consistency  
- Prompt engineering  
- Frame smoothing  
- GPU optimization on Colab  

## Insights
Getting clean output requires:

- Stable seeds  
- Low noise levels  
- Adequate inference steps  
- Good temporal coherence  

This project is ongoing, but the early results have been surprisingly strong.
