Dashboards are easy to make but hard to make *useful*.

I focus on dashboards that answer real questions, not just show charts.

## Use Cases I Built
### Finance (InvestWise)
- Portfolio performance  
- Asset allocation  
- Risk exposure  

### Legal (WeWin Legal Services)
- Deadlines  
- Case load by attorney  
- Document access logs  

### Academic / TA Work
- Attendance patterns  
- Student performance visualization  

## Principles I Follow
- Remove clutter  
- Highlight anomalies  
- Use simple colors  
- Make every visual answer a question  

Dashboards should guide decisions — that’s the standard I design for.
