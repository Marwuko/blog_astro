Living and studying in Korea has been one of the most transformative parts of my life.

## What Stands Out

### 1. Discipline & Work Ethic  
Korean academic culture is intense, but it pushes you to stay consistent.

### 2. Technology Everywhere  
Digital systems for classes, attendance, immigration, banking —  
everything is optimized.

### 3. Quiet Study Culture  
Libraries here are next-level.  
If you want to focus, this is the perfect environment.

### 4. Balancing TA Work & Studies  
Helping run classes, grading, and supporting faculty taught me  
organization and communication skills I didn’t have before.

Studying abroad is more than education —  
it changes how you see yourself.
