Being both a student and a teaching/research assistant requires managing  
assignments, grading, emails, meetings, and personal projects.

AI has become my silent partner in making all of this work.

## How I Use AI Daily

### 1. Research Summaries  
I use AI to break down long academic papers into structured summaries,  
but I always verify the references manually.

### 2. Cleaning Data  
Pandas scripts, SQL cleanup, formatting — AI helps me work faster and avoid small mistakes.

### 3. TA Responsibilities  
- Drafting rubric explanations  
- Writing announcements  
- Formatting attendance reports  
- Preparing slides  

### 4. Brainstorming Projects  
Many of my portfolio systems (InvestWise, AutoDutyChecker, AVA)  
started as rough AI-assisted drafts and grew into full projects.

## The Rule That Matters
AI doesn’t replace thinking — it *amplifies* it.  
When used well, it removes friction so you can focus on creativity and problem-solving.
