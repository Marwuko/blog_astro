Most people learn AI through notebooks, but real systems require more than model training.

## Key Lessons

### 1. Data Matters More Than Models  
A good dataset will beat a fancy model almost every time.

### 2. Architecture Must Be Modular  
AVA taught me this.  
Small, reusable “skills” made the assistant far easier to scale.

### 3. Logs and Observability Are Critical  
You need to know:

- what ran  
- how long it took  
- where failures happened  

### 4. Human Feedback Improves Systems  
Early testers shaped my import duty calculator and portfolio system.

### 5. Good UX Makes AI Useful  
People care more about simplicity than underlying complexity.

These lessons guide every new AI project I build.
