Legal information in Ghana is not always accessible, especially to  
students and citizens who don’t know where to look.

This project aims to change that.

## Concept
The assistant uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:

- The Ghanaian constitution  
- Key acts and statutes  
- Clean, structured chunking  
- Accurate citations  

Users can ask:

- “What does the constitution say about freedom of speech?”  
- “How does Ghana handle property disputes?”  

## Vision
A legal assistant that is:

- accurate  
- educational  
- accessible to everyone  

This project reflects my broader interest in **AI for civic impact**.
