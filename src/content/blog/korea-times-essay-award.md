In July 2025, I received a **Commendation Award** in **The 21st English Economic Essay Contest**, hosted by **The Korea Times** and **Woori Bank**.

My essay, titled **“Bridging borders in banking: Foreigner’s perspective,”** explored how Korea’s financial system can become more inclusive for foreigners—focusing on:

- Everyday barriers like language and documentation  
- The digital gap in mobile banking and fintech  
- Practical steps banks can take to improve access for international residents  

The essay was published in *The Korea Times* as part of the competition’s national feature.
