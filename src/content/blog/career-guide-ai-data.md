There’s a lot of noise online about how to enter the AI and data science field.  
But from my own experience — studying, building projects, and securing hands-on roles —  
the journey becomes clearer when you focus on *practical* steps instead of hype.

## 1. Start With Solid Fundamentals
You don’t need a PhD, but you *do* need:

- Python  
- SQL  
- Data cleaning  
- Basic machine learning  

These are the core tools you’ll use everywhere.

## 2. Build Real Projects (Not Just Tutorials)
I learned more from building:

- a dog-breed classifier  
- transformer sentiment model  
- portfolio management database  
- import duty calculator  

…than any course alone could teach.

Projects prove you can *apply* knowledge.

## 3. Choose One Specialty to Start
AI is huge. Pick an entry path:

- Data Analysis  
- Machine Learning  
- NLP  
- Computer Vision  
- Data Engineering  
- Automation  

Then branch out later.

## 4. Showcase Your Work
A portfolio website (like this one) is worth more than 100 certificates.

Employers want proof — not just statements.

## 5. Stay Consistent
Learning AI isn’t one big jump.  
It’s thousands of small steps taken consistently.

This guide summarizes the same roadmap that helped me upgrade from student → practitioner.
