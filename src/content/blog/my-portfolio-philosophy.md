I treat my portfolio projects like real products — not just demonstrations.

Here’s the philosophy that guides everything I build:

## 1. Solve Real Problems  
AutoDutyChecker solves import uncertainty.  
InvestWise helps with financial tracking.  
AVA reduces repetitive office tasks.

## 2. Build Systems, Not Demos  
A simple model is not enough.  
Real value comes from:

- data pipelines  
- interfaces  
- automations  
- reporting  

## 3. Combine AI + Databases + UX  
My projects combine all three because that’s what real systems require.

## 4. Tell the Story  
Every project should explain:

- why it matters  
- who it helps  
- what you learned  

This makes your work memorable and meaningful — not just “another GitHub repo.”
