This program was a turning point for me.  
Three months of challenging projects, cloud workflows, and real mentorship.

## What I Built
- Dog-Breed Image Classifier  
- Transformer Sentiment Model  
- Model evaluation pipelines  
- AWS-based workflows for training and inference  

## What Surprised Me
The most valuable part wasn’t the code —  
it was learning **how to think like an AI engineer**:

- debugging GPU issues  
- understanding model drift  
- interpreting confusion matrices  
- optimizing training loops  

## Why It Mattered
It gave me the confidence to take on bigger AI projects and understand  
what production-level AI systems require beyond just “model accuracy.”

If you are considering a serious path into applied AI,  
this program will push you — in a good way.
