NLP feels different from computer vision — the challenge is not just the data,  
but the ambiguity of language.

This project explored how transformer models classify sentiment in movie reviews.

## Process
- Loaded a pre-trained transformer  
- Tokenized the text  
- Batched sequences  
- Fine-tuned on labeled sentiment data  
- Evaluated with accuracy and F1 score  

## Key Learning
Even small adjustments in:

- learning rate  
- number of epochs  
- batch size  

…can significantly influence performance.

This project showed me how powerful (and sensitive) transformers can be.
