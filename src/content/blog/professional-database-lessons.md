Two of my most challenging projects were **InvestWise** (finance)  
and **WeWin Legal Services** (legal practice management).

Both required me to think like a systems architect,  
not just a database designer.

## Key Lessons
### 1. Requirements matter more than tables  
Understanding workflows and compliance rules shaped the schema.

### 2. Relationships should reflect real-world logic  
Clients → Accounts → Transactions  
Clients → Matters → Documents  

### 3. SQL is more than SELECT  
I built:

- views  
- rollups  
- risk calculations  
- deadline alerts  

### 4. Reporting is the real value  
Dashboards and reports help firms make decisions, not just store data.

These projects taught me how to build *business-first* databases that stand up to real use.
