This project is part of my work in the **Future AWS AI Scientist** program with Udacity.

The goal was to build a **dog breed classifier** that can identify the breed of a dog from an input image using a pre-trained deep learning model.

**What I did**

- Used a pre-trained CNN model and fine-tuned it for dog-breed recognition.  
- Processed image data and organized it into training, validation, and test sets.  
- Deployed and ran the model using AWS tooling and a reproducible notebook workflow.  

**Why it matters**

This project strengthened my understanding of transfer learning, model evaluation, and how to take a computer vision workflow from experimentation to a more production-ready structure on AWS.
