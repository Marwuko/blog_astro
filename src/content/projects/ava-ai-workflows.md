AVA (AI Virtual Assistant) is a system I’m building to reduce “click work” for knowledge workers.
Instead of manually updating Excel files, copying numbers into PowerPoint, or refreshing dashboards,
users describe what they want in plain English and AVA orchestrates the actions.

**Key ideas**

- A modular **skills** architecture where each tool (Excel, PowerPoint, databases, dashboards) plugs in as a separate capability.
- An AI layer that interprets user intent and maps it to the right sequence of skills.
- Clear logs and confirmations so users always see *what* AVA is doing on their behalf.

**What AVA can do**

- “Update the monthly sales report and generate a 5-slide summary deck.”
- “Pull the latest data for Ghana, filter by region, and export as a clean CSV.”
- “Prepare a one-page status dashboard for our AI projects.”

This project combines my interests in **AI, databases, and practical automation**.  
The goal is not just a chatbot, but a reliable teammate that actually gets real work done.
