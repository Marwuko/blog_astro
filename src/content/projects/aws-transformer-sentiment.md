This project, completed in the **Future AWS AI Scientist** program, focused on **natural language processing** using transformer models.

**Highlights**

- Built a sentiment classifier that labels movie reviews as positive or negative.
- Used a pre-trained transformer model and fine-tuned it on a labeled dataset.
- Evaluated performance with metrics like accuracy and F1 score, and inspected example predictions.

**What I learned**

- Practical steps for fine-tuning transformers for text classification.
- Tokenization, batching, and handling variable sequence lengths.
- How model performance changes with training time, learning rate, and dataset size.

Together with the dog-breed classifier, this project demonstrates my ability to work with **both vision and text AI workloads** on AWS.
