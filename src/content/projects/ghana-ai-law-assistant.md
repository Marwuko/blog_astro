The Ghana AI Law Assistant is a project concept I am developing to make **Ghanaian laws and the constitution** more accessible.

The idea is to provide a conversational interface where users can ask:

- “What are my rights in this situation?”
- “What does the constitution say about this topic?”
- “Which sections of the law apply to this type of case?”

**Planned capabilities**

- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over the Ghanaian constitution and key statutes.
- Clear citations so users can see **exactly which sections** the AI is referencing.
- Different modes for **citizens**, **students**, and **legal professionals**.

This project combines my background in **data, AI, and civic impact**, and fits into my broader goal of building tools that are genuinely useful in the Ghanaian context.
