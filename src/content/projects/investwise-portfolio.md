InvestWise is a fictional but realistic **portfolio management platform** I designed and implemented as a capstone for my **Data & Information Management** coursework.

The goal was to model how a small investment firm could manage clients, accounts, assets, and transactions while staying compliant with business and regulatory rules.

**Core design**

- Relational schema with entities for `Client`, `Account`, `Asset`, `Advisor`, and `Transaction`.
- Business rules such as **unique client IDs**, age restrictions for certain products, and audit-friendly transaction history.
- Carefully designed keys and relationships to enforce integrity and simplify reporting.

**Analytics & reporting**

- SQL queries to calculate portfolio performance, asset allocation, and risk exposure.
- Views and reports that highlight clients with unusual activity or concentration risk.
- Structure ready for BI tools (e.g., Power BI or Tableau) to sit on top for dashboards.

InvestWise demonstrates my ability to go from **business requirements → ER design → SQL implementation → practical reporting** in a financial context.
