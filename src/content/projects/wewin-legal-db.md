WeWin Legal Services is a legal-practice scenario where I designed a **case and document management database** to help a law firm manage information more safely and efficiently.

**What the system tracks**

- Clients, matters, case types, and assigned attorneys.
- Documents (contracts, filings, evidence) with metadata for access control.
- Court dates, tasks, and reminders to reduce the risk of missed deadlines.

**Technical focus**

- Normalized schema with clear relationships between clients, matters, and documents.
- SQL queries to list upcoming deadlines, active cases by attorney, and document activity.
- Reporting structure that supports **compliance and auditability**: who accessed what, when.

This project pushed me to think carefully about **data governance, access control, and legal record-keeping**, not just tables and queries.
